Hack Request: Add SMS to Ohana
======

Ohana [has an API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api), so there should be a text message interface that might (for instance) let you text to find free food near you.

About Ohana: Ohana API provides any city or county with an open-source framework for opening up a dataset of community-based organizations, and keeping the information up to date. [SMC Connect](http://www.smc-connect.org/) is an example of an app built on this framework.
